Description:
This SCAPES software allowed the user to create, load, save, compile, and run a program that was written by SCAPES language.  The strategy pattern is used for handling different kinds of statements. Each statement's behavior could be modified easily. It means that only one class needs to be edit. It is not necessary to understand other's statement in this situation.

Test-Program:
largeNumberPrint - allow user to input two numbers, and the program will print the large number.

secretNumberGues - allow one user to input a secret number, and then second user to input a number to guess the secret number, the loop will keep going on until the second user's number is larger than the first user's.


Be Aware!
Your program must have an ‘end’ to indicate the end of the program. Otherwise, it won’t compile.
